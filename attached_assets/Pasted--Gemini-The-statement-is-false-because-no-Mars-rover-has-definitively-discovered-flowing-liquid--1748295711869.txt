**Gemini**: The statement is false because no Mars rover has definitively discovered flowing liquid water on Mars as of October 26, 2023. While there is strong evidence of past liquid water and the potential for subsurface water ice or even briny water, no direct observation of flowing liquid water has been made. Recurring Slope Lineae (RSL) were initially thought to be potential evidence of flowing briny water, but further research suggests they are likely caused by granular flows. While scientists believe that Mars may have harbored life in the past and the possibility of extant microbial life, especially in subsurface environments, remains open, no such life has been discovered. The statement conflates the hope for discovering life with confirmed discoveries.

**Mistral**: The statement is false because, as of now, there is no confirmed discovery of liquid water flowing on Mars in 2023 by NASA's Mars rover. While there have been indications of water ice and possible signs of liquid water in the past, no definitive evidence of flowing liquid water has been reported in 2023. Additionally, the hypothesis about extremophile bacteria is speculative and not supported by concrete evidence from Mars missions.

**GPT-4**: GPT would analyze this statement by examining its factual elements, checking for internal consistency, and comparing against established knowledge.

**Perplexity**: The statement claims that NASA's Mars rover discovered liquid water flowing on Mars in 2023. However, the available sources do not support this specific claim. The sources indicate that while there is evidence of liquid water on Mars, it is not flowing on the surface but rather is hidden beneath the surface in underground reservoirs or aquifers. For example, source [3] mentions seismic clues suggesting liquid water may be hiding beneath Mars' surface, and source [5] discusses a vast underground reservoir of liquid water discovered by NASA's InSight lander in 2024. There is no mention of liquid water flowing on the surface in 2023.

**Database Verification**: NASA data verification: NASA Mars rover data confirms active missions on Mars. Curiosity rover has captured 856 photos, validating Mars exploration activities.
