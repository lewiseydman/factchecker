Historical Context
The search for water on Mars is crucial to understanding the planet's past habitability and the potential for life. Evidence from orbiters and rovers has revealed ancient riverbeds, lake basins, and mineral deposits that suggest abundant liquid water existed on Mars billions of years ago. Current research focuses on finding evidence of extant water, possibly in the form of subsurface ice or aquifers. The discovery of liquid water would be a major breakthrough in the search for life beyond Earth.

**Gemini**: The statement is false. While the search for liquid water on Mars is a major focus of ongoing research, no Mars rover has definitively discovered flowing liquid water on the surface as of October 26, 2023. Evidence suggests the presence of ancient water and possible subsurface water ice or even briny aquifers, but direct observation of flowing liquid water remains elusive. While scientists hypothesize that if liquid water were found, it *could* potentially harbor extremophile life similar to that found in Earth's extreme environments, this remains speculative until such water is actually discovered and analyzed. The statement conflates the hope of finding life with confirmed discovery.
